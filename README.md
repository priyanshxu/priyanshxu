## Projects

### [DATA VALIDATION API](https://github.com/Akanksha-neural-networks/Data_Validation_API.git)
This was a major project I did recently. We created an interface for the user where he/she can access, compare and
gather data from different databases source like MySql, Snowflake and PostgreSQL. For the backend we used Nest.js and 
Typescript. 
And for the frontend we used Next.js, typescript and css as well. We built this interface particularly for data analysts
who have a lot of issue when they have to compare and contrast things.
